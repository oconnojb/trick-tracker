# trick-tracker
Do you have so many dogs that you can't keep track of who knows which trick? This app is for you!!

# using trick-tracker
Until trick-tracker is it's own cool webpage, you'll have to fork and clone the girhub repo. Once you've got everything all set, run the command `shotgun` and the app will be opened on a local web server. Navigate to the place it tells you in your favorite browser and get started tracking tricks!
