# trick-tracker
Do you have so many dogs that you can't keep track of who knows which trick? This app is for you!!

# using trick-tracker
Until trick-tracker is it's own cool webpage, you'll have to fork and clone the github repo.

Run 'bundle install' to make sure the gems are installed!

Once you've got everything all set, run the command `shotgun` and the app will be opened on a local web server.

Navigate to the place it tells you in your favorite browser and get started tracking tricks!
